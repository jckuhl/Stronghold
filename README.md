# Stronghold

This is a project I made as a teenager.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work.  I wanted to put it here for the sake of personal history however.  This was a defend-the-castle type game.  Stick figures and various bad guys would attack your castle.  You had to shoot them before they got to it,  You could buy defenses that would help defend your castle.

There were going to be 30 levels to beat, but the game kept spawning enemies at odd times and I never figured out why, so after level 2ish it started getting wonky.  So I never finished it.

The .wdl files are the game code.  WDL is "world definition language" and it was written in something called C-Script, a derivitive of C++ with a lot of the low level stuff stripped away.  C-Script is now Lite-C, which is still derivitive but has better interoperability with native C++, if I remember right.  It might have been C, it's a long time ago after all; this project is like 12 years dead and I don't even know if 3d Gamestudio, the engine used to make this game, even exists anymore.

The .mdl files are models, compatible with Milkshape.  The .wmb files are world map files for the 3d Gamestudio level editor.

If you have access to 3d Gamestudio and want to finish the project, be my guest.  I just wanted to push this to Github as a curiousity from my earliest programming experiences.  And if you look at my code . . . bad practices abound lol.
